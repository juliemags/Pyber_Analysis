# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview
The intention of this analysis is to compare the weekly fares and how the fares are affected by a variety of data points. This assignment came to us from our CEO and Manager, and the purpose of this assignment is to prepare for the real-life questions our leaders may ask if we continue with a career in data analysis and programming. Using Pandas and MatPlotLib, we will explore how fares are affected by city types. 

## Analysis
From our analysis, we ended up with the following outcome:

We can determine the following takeaways from our data: 
- The city type with the most rides was the "Urban" city type (1625 rides)
- Urban cities also have 2,405 total drivers, while there are only 78 rural drivers
- The average fare per ride is highest in Rural settings ($34.62) and lowest in Urban settings ($24.53)
- The average fare per driver follows the same pattern as average fares per ride, with Rural having the highest average fare per driver ($55.49) and Urban having the lowest fare ($16.57)
- Though having the lowest fare, Urban rides had the most fares ($39,854.38) and Rural had the lowest total fares ($4,327.93)

We can also see the total weekly fare by city type below:

## Summary
From our analysis, we can see that Urban cities have a much larger volume of rides than suburban or rural cities. From this, however, the value per ride is higher in rural cities than Urban. If you were a driver who prioritized highest fares, you would want to drive in Rural areas. Even though the fare is higher, since there are not as many rides, the take-home pay on the day may not be as high as the Urban rides. There are also less drivers to compete with in rural areas. In urban areas, a driver may struggle to find rides, as the volume of drivers is much higher. In the long run, a driver will make more money overall in Urban areas than suburban or rural areas. Fares also follow a relatively similar pattern across rural, suburban, and urban cities. If there is a peak in price in rural fares, there is likely to be a peak in suburban and urban fares as well.
